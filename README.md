## 📌 Notes
- Most projects were completed under **bootcamp conditions**, with high workload and strict deadlines. The non bootcamp projects were realised alongside regular classes. 
- Team projects required strong collaboration, version control with Git, and agile practices.  
- Solo projects tested autonomy, problem-solving, rigor, stress management.
